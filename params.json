Use this code! (jQuery is needed!)\r\n```\r\n$(document).ready(function(){\r\n  $.getJSON('https://mcapi.us/server/status?ip=c.nerd.nu', function(obj){\r\n    if(obj.online === true){\r\n      motdHTML = replaceColorCodes(obj.motd);\r\n      console.log(motdHTML);\r\n    } else {\r\n      console.log(\"Server is offline...\");\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n})\r\n```\r\nhttps://mcapi.us provides JSON responses from the server provided in the URL.

Well yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Thank you everyone for the downloads, and Enjoy!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
